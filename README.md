# News-Classification
 
 Classifying Data as True or Fake news based on weights assigned to each a every word.
 This is done by selecting each word and checking if it is a positive or negative word.
 But before this is done, we have to manipulate the data:
 1. Convert the Text into lower case.
 2. Remove stop words.
 3. Remove punctuations.
 4. Remove stop words after removing punctuations.
 5. Lemmatize the text.
 
 After all this is done, the data is classified using the following algorithms.
 
 1. Logistic Regression  
 2. Decision Tree  
 3. Random Forest

 Finnaly arrive at the evaluation part,
 Accuracy of the models:
 
 1. Logistic Regression : 98.49%
 2. Decision Tree       : 99.65%
 3. Random Forest       : 98.92%
